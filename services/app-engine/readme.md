### App Engine Flex
App Engine Flex is a variant whereby you can run *any* runtime, including for languages or frameworks that are not natively supported by App Engine. This does remove the management advantage that regular App Engine offers, but allows you to run your code without having to potentially port it to a supported runtime.
