# Google Cloud Logging
## What is it?
Google Cloud Logging is a fairly catch-all logging solution that comes with a number of expandable components to allow you to configure it for use in a near limitless number of ways. Different solutions and companies require different logic, thresholds, alerting mechanisms and so forth and so it is designed to be as flexible as possible.
## Why use it?
Simply put, the best argument for using Cloud Logging is the fact that it is natively integrated with so many GCP services and is so flexible. Implementing another logging solution would be much more effort than simply leveraging this service. Did I mention that much of the core functionality is free?
