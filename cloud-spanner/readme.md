# Cloud Spanner

## What is it?
Cloud Spanner is a horizontally scalable, strongly consistent, distributed SQL database. It fills the "bigger-than-your-average-database" role while maintaining the advantages of services such as Cloud SQL.

## Why use it?
Cloud Spanner is the go-to for any databases that have outgrown a database plus a couple of read replicas. If you're hosting your database in GCP and you find yourself considering sharding, you should consider Cloud Spanner instead and save yourself the headache.
