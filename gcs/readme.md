# Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

## What is it?
GCS is quite similar to the widely used and loved S3 service from AWS - it is an object-based storage service, billed by the GB, has the concept of buckets, the ability to configure lifecycle management, access control configurations - the comparisons could last all day. The key takeaway from and AWS background is that they are very similar. However GCS does offer some "premium" S3 configurations as standard.
